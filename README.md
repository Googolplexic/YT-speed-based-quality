**YouTube Speed-based Quality Adjuster**

A **Chrome Extension** that, when adjusting the speed of a video, automatically lowers or raises the quality of the video based on inputted settings.

Useful for not wanting to use up all of your data/bandwidth when trying to quickly skim through a series of videos without the need for high quality, such as a video game 'Let's Play' playlist. 

Speed settings go all the way up to 4 times speed in case you have another extension installed that increases your speed to beyond the default 2 times speed.
